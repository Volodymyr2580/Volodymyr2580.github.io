## Research Interests

- [Internet of Everything](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=search_authors&hl=zh-CN&mauthors=label:internet_of_everything)
- 

My current research focuses on deep learning methods for scientific problems, especially those related to geophysics. I'm currently studying geophysics and mathematics and researching on full waveform inversion techniques and its applications in ChangE'4 Lunar Penetrating Radar data.

In the near future, I'll probably be working on reinforcement learning, stochastic analysis, stochastic mechanics and deep learning principles.
